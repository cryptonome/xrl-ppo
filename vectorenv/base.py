    It accepts a list of environment generators. In other words, an environment
    generator ``efn`` of a specific task means that ``efn()`` returns the
    environment of the given task, for example, ``gym.make(task)``.

    All of the VectorEnv must inherit :class:`~tianshou.env.BaseVectorEnv`.
    Here are some other usages:
    ::
